### Pages

> App pages are structured by functionality

* Auth: Login, Logout, new pages will be added soon
* Contropanel: Core pages, anything under this directory is protected by the Auth Guard

_Note_ We are lazy loading our components so each page folder should contain its own modules and routing file, also for common features you should include the feature service and interface file
